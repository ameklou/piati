<h1>[ZAP] Protecting the rights of people affected by the armed conflict in Zamboanga City and Basilan, Western Mindanao</h1>


<p class="lead">a. To ensure the active participation of the affected population and other extremely vulnerable
groups in planning and carrying out recovery, return, relocation and/or resettlement activities
b. To orient and provide information to the affected communities at large - be they in evacuation
centres, transitional shelters or places of origins - about assistance and services available from
government and other humanitarian actors so that they are able to make better informed and
sound decisions about their situation, as well as access assistance and services in a timely and
effective manner
c. Rapidly train local volunteers in protection monitoring and reporting, in collaboration with the
Human Rights Commission of Region IX
d. To immediately provide ‘protection kits’ and/or non-food items (NFIs) to affected population, with
priority to vulnerable groups and persons with specific needs (PWSNs) - specifically items that are
envisaged to have an immediate effect to their wellbeing and dignity, e.g. mats, hygiene kits,
medicines, assistive devices, etc.
e. To provide psychosocial support and debriefing to people displaced and/or affected by the armed
conflict, including the caregivers and/or first responders.</p>
