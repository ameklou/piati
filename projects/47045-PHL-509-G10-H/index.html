          This is a demonstration application to explore what data donors have 
          already published. You should not rely on it to make decisions about
          allocation or about the current nature of different donors' activities.

<h1>Upscaling the national response to HIV-AIDS through the delivery of services and information to population at risk and people living with HIV/AIDS</h1>

<div class="pull-right"><div class="alert alert-success">Completion</div></div>


<p class="lead">HIV prevalence in the Philippines is one of the lowest in the region. However concern is growing that the epidemic may spread exponentially within a few years if the country does not intensify its prevention activities. The program supported by this Round 5 grant focuses on scaling up the national response to HIV through the delivery of services and information to populations at risk and people living with HIV. Specific objectives include maintaining prevalence among vulnerable groups at less than 1 percent and reducing the impact of HIV and AIDS on individuals, families and communities. The program will implement a set of comprehensive activities aimed at reducing transmission among vulnerable groups (including people in prostitution, people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, and migrant workers); scaling up support, care and treatment for people who live with HIV and their families; strengthening health management and delivery systems at both the national and local level; and conducting operational research involving out-of-school youths, street children, the informal workforce and seafarers to assess their level of risk and vulnerability.</p>
