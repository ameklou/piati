<h1>Typhoon Bopha: Joint Response - Approaches Designed for Indigenous Peoples</h1>


<p class="lead">This emergency disaster response for IPs will work towards a two interrelated objectives, as follows: 
1.	To provide the IP victims of the disaster, men and women, girls and boys, an immediate source of income for them to satisfy their most basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter and medicines, while helping to restore the damaged infrastructure in their community or ancestral domain; 
2.	To strengthen the capacity of the same IP victims to effect and sustain the recovery of their livelihoods and gradually bring back normalcy into their family  and community life, including sending their children back to school; and
3.	To enhance the capacity of the IPs for indigenous knowledge systems and practices (IKSP)-based capacity for disaster preparedness and disaster risks reduction and management.
Benefits from the intervention of the ILO,  FAO, UNFPA as well as the various implementing partners will go to the IPs who are seriously affected by typhoon Pablo including women and the youth, the elderly, women-headed households and survivors of related gender-based violence. The project will directly benefit, among others, 2,800 workers under the emergency employment (cash-for-work) operations, including the rebuilding of damaged houses; and 2,500 IP families through the provision of support for the recovery of their livelihoods.  Other IP families will be assisted to escape calamity-motivated exploitation such as trafficking, in which women and girls are most affected, child labour and loss of ancestral lands.</p>
