<h1>Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme, 4th Operational Phase</h1>

<div class="pull-right"><div class="alert alert-success">Implementation</div></div>


<p class="lead">The Small Grants Programme, through hundreds of demand-driven community-based projects implemented by NGOs and CBOs, supports the achievement of GEF Focal Area Strategies and their indicators. Though pre-project quantification is not possible within a demand driven approach, SGP projects will in particular contribute to: (a) strengthening the Protected Areas (PA) systems of its participating countries in terrestrial as well as marine/freshwater protected areas by catalyzing community-indigenous initiatives that promote the participation and capacity building of local community and indigenous groups in the design, implementation, management and monitoring of efforts to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use; mainstreaming biodiversity in production Iandscapes /seascapes by demonstrating improved livelihoods based on sustainable use and harvest; generation, dissemination and uptake of good practices through increased innovation in project design and implementation; (b) promotion of sustainable mobility through non-motorized transport; electricity production from rural renewable energy installations; support growth of interest in Iow-GHG emitting electricity generating technologies; piloting and demonstration of operational approaches to community-based adaptation; (C) improving the performance and sustainability of transboundary institutions (e.g. support for community-based projects to complement PEMSEA’s national and regional initiatives); support IW programme area- foundational/capacity building through demonstration projects that engage local stakeholders on transboundary concerns; support the adoption of local/national reforms by SIDS through water- related demos; (d) dissemination of information on best practices regarding POPs management; promotion of partnerships in demonstration of innovative technologies and practices in POPs reduction; (e) implementation of NGO-led or community-based Sustainable Land Management (SLM) initiatives that apply innovative and best practices in demonstration areas; development of innovative knowledge products that will fill identified knowledge gaps in the Land Degradation (LD) focal area; implementation of interventions that promote cross focal area synergies and integrated ecosystem approaches to SLM; (f) support to enabling activities and cross-cutting capacity building by strengthening civil society participation.The GEF SGP is implemented byUNDP on behalf of the three implementing agencies of the GEF — UNDP, World Bank, and UNEP — and executed by UNOPS. SGP will continue to operate in a highly decentralized and country-driven manner through a National Coordinator (NC) and National Steering Committee (NSC) in each participating country, with support from the UNDP Country Office and in some countries, a National Host Institution (NH I) or host NGO. The UNDP-CPMT and UNOPS will provide, as before, global guidance, coordination, support, and supervision. The UNDP GEF Unit at UNDP Headquarters in New York manages all of its GEF activities, including SGP. The UNDP GEF Executive Coordinator and his/her Deputy are accountable, both to UNDP and to the GEF Secretariat and Council, for all UNDP GEE activities, including SGP. The UNDP Central Programme Management Team (CPMT), located within the UNDP/GEF Unit, is composed of the Global Manager, Deputy Global Manager (Programme), Deputy Global Manager (Operations), Climate Change Programme Officer, Biodiversity Programme Officer, Land Degradation/International Waters/POPs Programme Officer, Knowledge Facilitator, Programme Associate, and Administrative Assistant. The CPMT is responsible for the overall programme, provides operational guidance and support to the country programmes, including identification and establishment of the SGP in new countries, and reports to the GEF Secretariat and Council. Through a global M&amp;E framework and communications strategy, it monitors country programmes and coordinates the documentation and dissemination of lessons learned from the programme’s community-based experiences. UNOPS following agreed procedures, policy and strategy with the CPMT will continue to be responsible for providing programme management (in financial and administrative areas) and execution support services in the following areas: (1 ) personnel recruitment and contract administration for project staff and consultants; (2) subcontracts for host institutions; (3) monitoring, supervision and authorization of country programme grant allocations and disbursements; (4) budget administration, including authorization and monitoring of expenditures; (5) training and guidance on the above to country-level project staff; and (6) support for initiation of the programme in new countries. The UNDP Country Office (CO) following SGP Operational Guidelines will continue to participate in providing overall management support to operations in each of the SGP country programmes. The UN Resident Representative (or Res. Coordinator) in each Country Office assigns a staff member to serve as the SGP focal point, and the RRIRC or the focal point as his/her delegate participates in the NSC. Each UNDP CO also contributes to monitoring programme activities — usually through broad oversight by the designated focal point as part of NSC responsibilities; facilitates interaction with the host government; and develops links with other in a country financial and technical resources. The CO is also responsible for providing financial and administrative services to the programme, and the Resident Representative signs the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with NGO/CBO grantees, on behalf of UNOPS. The Country Office administers the disbursement of grant payments in accordance with the terms of the MOA and as authorized by UNOPS. It also plays a fundamental role in launching a new SGP programme and in the appointment of National Steering Committee (NSC) members once ratified by the CPMT. As the programme has evolved, the UNDP Country Office is also expected to help develop the links between SGP and the other GEE Implementing Agencies and Executing Agencies at country level. In some countries, the SGP is located in a National Host Institution (‘IHI), normally a national non- governmental organization (NGO) or national environment fund. Programme hosting arrangements are normally considered during a new country appraisal mission. UNOPS administers a subcontract for professional services with the host NGO that outlines the technical support and administrative services to be provided and an operating budget. The sub-contract contains rules of collaboration with the host organization as defined in the offer or terms of reference, both of which are integral parts of the subcontract. This contract is supervised by UNOPS. All country programmes, whether based in the UNDP or in a host NGO, equally respond to the SGP Strategic Framework, Operational Guidelines, and other global programme guidance. The following NGOs have been identified as National Host Institutions (NHI) for the 4th Phase - some of which more recently - for the respective countries: Brazil - Instituto Sociedade, PopuIao E Natureza (ISPN), Cook Islands - CIANGO, Dominca - Dominica Saves the Children Fund (hosts SGP COMPACT), Egypt - Arab Office for Youth and Environment (AOYE), India - Cents for Environmental Education (CEE), Indonesia - Yayasan bina Usha Lingkungan (YBUL), Jordan - Jordan Royal Ecological Diving Society (JREDS), Namibia - Namibia Nature Foundation, Tunisia - L&#39;Audit Environnemental (AE), Micronesia - Mcronesia Conservation Trust (MCT), Palau - Palau Conservation Society (PCS), Tonag - Civil Society Forum for Tonga (CSFT), Tuvalu - Tuvalu Association of NGOs (TANGO), Vanuatu - Vanuatu Association of NGOs (VANGO), Zambia - Keepers Zambia Foundation.The National Steering Committee (NSC) is composed of voluntary members from NGOs, academic and scientific institutions, other civil society organizations, the UNDP Country Office, government, and donors in cases of large scale co-financing, with a majority of members coming from the non-governmental sector It provides overall guidance and direction to the country programme, and contributes to developing and implementing strategies for country programme sustainability. The National Coordinator (NC) has the lead responsibility for managing country programme implementation. The NC reports to the CPMT and UNOPS as required. The budget comprises of four main components: A. Grants B. Programme mobilization, strategic guidance and M&amp;E C. Programme management (with two subcomponents) 1. Country-level 2. Global programme-level (HQ) D. Administrative costs /UNOPS Management Fee. It should be noted that the country operating budgets (COB) for each participating SGP country comes from the component A for the Grants and component C.1 . for personnel and country administrative costs.</p>
